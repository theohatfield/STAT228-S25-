## About Me!
Theo Hatfield 

Simmons Univeristy Biochemistry, 2025

My primary interests are in infectious disease pathology and cell signaling. I am really interested in learning to use more bioinformatic methods to apply to my research work!
Presently my skills are predominantly in bench work including western blot, ICH, and Drosophila husbandry. 

## What is this blog?
This is intended to be a space to share my work from the introduction to data science course I am taking in Spring 2025!

## Projects
### [Mini Project 1: Perceptions of Masculininty in Straight Versus Non-Straigt Males](https://theohatfield.github.io/STAT228_MINIPROJ_1/)

This project aims to provide a basic intro to wrangling data. It may not be as daring as snake wrangling, but it is definitely more useful for data scientists!
