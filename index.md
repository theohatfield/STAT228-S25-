## About Me!
Theo Hatfield 

Simmons Univeristy Biochemistry, 2025

My primary interests are in infectious disease pathology and cell signaling. I am really interested in learning to use more bioinformatic methods to apply to my research work!
Presently my skills are predominantly in bench work including western blot, ICH, and Drosophila husbandry. 

## What is this blog?
This is intended to be a space to share my work from the introduction to data science course I am taking in Spring 2025!
